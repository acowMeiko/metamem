    "question": "A novice economist-cryptographer received a cryptogram from a ruler which contained a secret decree about implementing an itemized tax on a certain market. The cryptogram specified the amount of tax revenue that needed to be collected, emphasizing that a greater amount could not be collected in that market. Unfortunately, the economist-cryptographer made an error in decrypting the cryptogram—the digits of the tax revenue amount were identified in the wrong order. Based on erroneous data, a decision was made to introduce an itemized tax on producers of 90 monetary units per unit of goods. It is known that the market demand is represented by \\( Q_d = 688 - 4P \\), and the market supply is linear. When there are no taxes, the price elasticity of market supply at the equilibrium point is 1.5 times higher than the modulus of the price elasticity of the market demand function. After the tax was introduced, the producer price fell to 64 monetary units.\n\n1) Restore the market supply function.\n2) Determine the amount of tax revenue collected at the chosen rate.\n3) Determine the itemized tax rate that would meet the ruler's decree.\n4) What is the amount of tax revenue specified by the ruler to be collected?",
