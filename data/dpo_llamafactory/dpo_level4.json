    "question": "A novice economist-cryptographer received a cryptogram from a ruler which contained a secret decree about implementing an itemized tax on a certain market. The cryptogram specified the amount of tax revenue that needed to be collected, emphasizing that a greater amount could not be collected in that market. Unfortunately, the economist-cryptographer made an error in decrypting the cryptogram—the digits of the tax revenue amount were identified in the wrong order. Based on erroneous data, a decision was made to introduce an itemized tax on producers of 90 monetary units per unit of goods. It is known that the market demand is represented by \\( Q_d = 688 - 4P \\), and the market supply is linear. When there are no taxes, the price elasticity of market supply at the equilibrium point is 1.5 times higher than the modulus of the price elasticity of the market demand function. After the tax was introduced, the producer price fell to 64 monetary units.\n\n1) Restore the market supply function.\n2) Determine the amount of tax revenue collected at the chosen rate.\n3) Determine the itemized tax rate that would meet the ruler's decree.\n4) What is the amount of tax revenue specified by the ruler to be collected?",

    "question": "Find the largest positive integer  $N $  for which one can choose  $N $  distinct numbers from the set  ${1,2,3,...,100}$  such that neither the sum nor the product of any two different chosen numbers is divisible by  $100$ .\n\nProposed by Mikhail Evdokimov",
    "diff": "{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100\\}\\) such that neither the sum nor the product of any two different chosen numbers is divisible by 100. We will analyze the conditions modulo 4 and modulo 25 separately, and then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\n### Step 1: Consider the numbers modulo 4\nThe numbers modulo 4 can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. We need to ensure that the sum of any two chosen numbers is not 0 modulo 4. This means we cannot have both 0 and 0, both 1 and 3, or both 2 and 2. Therefore, we can choose at most one 0, at most one 2, and at most one of 1 or 3. The best we can do is to choose 25 numbers that are 1 modulo 4 and 25 numbers that are 3 modulo 4, plus one number that is 0 modulo 4 and one number that is 2 modulo 4. This gives us a total of \\(25 + 25 + 1 + 1 = 52\\) numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Consider the numbers modulo 25\nThe numbers modulo 25 can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 24. We need to ensure that the product of any two chosen numbers is not 0 modulo 25. This means we cannot have any 0 modulo 25. The best we can do is to choose 24 numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 24\\}\\).\n\n### Step 3: Combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem\nWe need to choose numbers that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. From the analysis above, we can choose 24 numbers modulo 25 and 52 numbers modulo 4. We need to find a way to choose the maximum number of numbers that satisfy both conditions.\n\nWe can choose 24 numbers that are 1 modulo 4 and 24 numbers that are 3 modulo 4, plus one number that is 2 modulo 4. This gives us 49 numbers. We need to check if we can choose 24 numbers from these 49 that are also not 0 modulo 25. Since there are 24 numbers that are not 0 modulo 25 in each of the 49 chosen numbers, we can choose 24 numbers that satisfy both conditions.\n\nTherefore, the largest positive integer \\(N\\) for which one can choose \\(N\\) distinct numbers from the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 100\\}\\) such that neither the sum nor the product of any two different chosen numbers is divisible by 100 is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).\n\n### Verification:\nTo verify, let's consider the set of numbers that are 1 or 3 modulo 4 and not 0 modulo 25. We can choose 24 such numbers from each of these sets. Additionally, we can choose one number that is 2 modulo 4 and not 0 modulo 25. This gives us a total of 44 numbers.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{44}\\).\n\n<output format=\"json\">\n{{\n  \"differences\": [\n    {{\n      \"Aspect\": \"Combination of results\",\n      \"HighQuality\": \"The high-quality answer correctly combines the results from modulo 4 and modulo 25 conditions, verifying that the maximum number of numbers satisfying both conditions is 44.\",\n      \"LowQuality\": \"The low-quality answer concludes with 49 without verifying if all 49 numbers satisfy the modulo 25 condition.\",\n      \"Differences\": \"The high-quality answer correctly verifies the combination of conditions and ensures that the final number chosen does not violate the modulo 25 condition, leading to a more accurate result of 44 instead of 49.\"\n    }",
